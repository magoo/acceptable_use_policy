#Acceptable Use Policy
> This document is based on the SANS AUP available [here](https://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/general/pdf/acceptable-use-policy). Several modifications / additions have occurred, inspired by [An Information Security Policy for the Startup](https://medium.com/starting-up-security/starting-up-security-policy-104261d5438a)

## 1. Overview
Infosec’s intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use Policy are not to impose restrictions that
are contrary to <Company Name>’s established culture of openness, trust and integrity. Infosec
is committed to protecting <Company Name>'s employees, partners and the company from
illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to computer equipment,
software, operating systems, storage media, network accounts providing electronic mail, WWW
browsing, and FTP, are the property of <Company Name>. These systems are to be used for
business purposes in serving the interests of the company, and of our clients and customers in the
course of normal operations. Please review Human Resources policies for further details.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of every <Company
Name> employee and affiliate who deals with information and/or information systems. It is the
responsibility of every computer user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their activities
accordingly.

## 2. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer equipment at <Company
Name>. These rules are in place to protect the employee and <Company Name>. Inappropriate
use exposes <Company Name> to risks including virus attacks, compromise of network systems
and services, and legal issues.

## 3. Scope
This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing devices, and network
resources to conduct <Company Name> business or interact with internal networks and business
systems, whether owned or leased by <Company Name>, the employee, or a third party. All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary, and other workers at <Company Name> and its subsidiaries are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding appropriate use of
information, electronic devices, and network resources in accordance with <Company Name>
policies and standards, and local laws and regulation. Exceptions to this policy are documented
in section 5.2

This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and other workers at
<Company Name>, including all personnel affiliated with third parties. This policy applies to all
equipment that is owned or leased by <Company Name>.

## 4. Policy
### 4.1 General Use and Ownership
4.1.1 <Company Name> proprietary information stored on electronic and computing devices
whether owned or leased by <Company Name>, the employee or a third party, remains
the sole property of <Company Name>. You must ensure through legal or technical
means that proprietary information is protected in accordance with the Data Protection
Standard.
4.1.2 You have a responsibility to promptly report the theft, loss or unauthorized disclosure of
<Company Name> proprietary information.
4.1.3 You may access, use or share <Company Name> proprietary information only to the

4.1.4 Employees are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of
personal use. Individual departments are responsible for creating guidelines concerning
personal use of Internet/Intranet/Extranet systems. In the absence of such policies,
employees should be guided by departmental policies on personal use, and if there is any
uncertainty, employees should consult their supervisor or manager.
4.1.5 For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within
<Company Name> may monitor equipment, systems and network traffic at any time, per

4.2.2 Providing access to another individual, either deliberately or through failure to secure its access, is

4.2.8 Employees must encrypt their devices if asked, and must not interfere or otherwise reduce the level of encryption on their devices.

## 4.3 Unacceptable Use
The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g., systems administration staff may have a need to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting production services).

Under no circumstances is an employee of <Company Name> authorized to engage in any activity that is illegal under local, state, federal or international law while utilizing <Company Name>-owned resources.
