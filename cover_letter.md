> This is an example cover letter for an Acceptable Use Policy. This is useful in environments that are not used to heavy policing of policy or quickly rejects "corporate" documents. It helps clearly explain why this is useful.

> It's completely up to you to remove or rephrase both the policies or the cover letter's explanations.

# The Acceptable Use Policy
Our customers trust us. They expect us to protect what they've shared with us. They are not specific with their expectations, and that is a challenge for us in many ways.

- If our policies are ever inspected, a critique must find them to be reasonable.
- We should never fail to fend off well known and unsophisticated attacks.
- We must be effective at responding to, and investigating, failures to uphold our security.

A large part of expecting others to trust us is that subject ourselves to governance. This document describes these subjects in detail, and this cover letter is to help employees understand the importance of these subjects. Sometimes these documents can be intimidating, so this cover letter helps explain why we have some of these policies.

## General Use and Ownership
This section explains policy around separating work life and personal life as much as possible. Simply by virtue of employment, the systems you use for work have a _much lower expectation of privacy_ than your own personal equipment. You are most certainly allowed to use your devices for reasonable personal use, but it must be absolutely clear that these devices *are not yours*. Here is why:

- If we are sued, all devices we own are subject to discovery. This means opposing counsel will have access to your data.
- We have to troubleshoot our systems, which means administrators may have access to your data.
- We may have to terminate an employee. This is never a desirable outcome. But to make sure the business continues, we may have to give another employee access to their devices and accounts.
- We may be breached. In which case, outside investigators will have to inspect all usage of an account or a device, without regard for personal activity.

For these reasons, mostly out of our control, please limit personal usage of employee devices as much as possible, and remember that they are not yours. Our policies must be strict to make absolutely certain the risks to you, the company, and our users are as minimal as possible.

## Security and Proprietary Information
This section describes some minimum behaviors that are expected of you. Of note, your password hygiene, and the use of multifactor for authentication. Multifactor is an extremely important aspect of our security program that greatly reduces risk.

## Acceptable Use
The first point in this section is to make it absolutely clear in this section that severe consequences exist for severely malicious, negligent, or otherwise delinquent behavior. Do not break the law and do not cause intentional harm to others.

The second point we make in this section is that your employment does not make you a public representative of the organization. Our organization's public communication and brand are a tightly controlled function reserved for a specific organization and individuals in the company. Social media and email are specifically identified here, but overall, be conservative about how you represent yourself as an employee.

## Policy Compliance
This section makes it clear that the information security team has a role in measuring, enforcing, and allowing for exceptions to these rules. It also makes it clear that disciplinary action, including termination, are possible outcomes in violation of this policy.
